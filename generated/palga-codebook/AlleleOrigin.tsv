Maternal	Describes an allele that is inherited from a female parent in virtue of the allele being present in the mother's egg.	GENO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000878	Maternal
Paternal	Describes an allele that is inherited from a male parent in virtue of the allele being present in the father's sperm.	GENO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000879	Paternal
De novo	Describes an attribute describing an allele that originated through a mutation event in a germ cell of one of the parents or in the fertilized egg itself during early embryogenesis.	GENO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000880	De novo
Somatic	Describes an allele that result from some spontaneous mutation event in a somatic cell after fertilization and thus are not present in every cell in the body.	GENO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000882	Somatic
Germline	Describes an allele that is inherited from a parent in virtue of the allele being present in one or both of the parent's germ cells (sperm or egg).	GENO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000888	Germline
NoInformation (NI, nullflavor)	The value is exceptional (missing, omitted, incomplete, improper). No information as to the reason for being an exceptional value is provided. This is the most general exceptional value. It is also the default exceptional value.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NI	NoInformation (NI, nullflavor)
Invalid (INV, nullflavor)	The value as represented in the instance is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#INV	Invalid (INV, nullflavor)
Derived (DER, nullflavor)	An actual value may exist, but it must be derived from the provided information (usually an EXPR generic data type extension will be used to convey the derivation expression .	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#DER	Derived (DER, nullflavor)
Other (OTH, nullflavor)	The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable. (e.g., concept not provided by required code system).	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#OTH	Other (OTH, nullflavor)
Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)	Negative infinity of numbers.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NINF	Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)
Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)	Positive infinity of numbers.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#PINF	Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)
Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)	The actual value has not yet been encoded within the approved value domain.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNC	Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)
Masked (MSK, nullflavor)	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons. There may be an alternate mechanism for gaining access to this information.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#MSK	Masked (MSK, nullflavor)
Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)	Known to have no proper value (e.g., last menstrual period for a male).	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NA	Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)
Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)	A proper value is applicable, but not known.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNK	Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)
Asked but unknown (ASKU, nullflavor)	Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#ASKU	Asked but unknown (ASKU, nullflavor)
Temporarily unavailable (NAV, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time but it is expected that it will be available later.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NAV	Temporarily unavailable (NAV, nullflavor)
Not asked (NASK, nullflavor)	This information has not been sought. (e.g., patient was not asked)	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NASK	Not asked (NASK, nullflavor)
Not available (NAVU, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time (with no expectation regarding whether it will or will not be available in the future).	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NAVU	Not available (NAVU, nullflavor)
Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)	The specific quantity is not known, but is known to be non-zero and is not specified because it makes up the bulk of the material. e.g. 'Add 10mg of ingredient X, 50mg of ingredient Y, and sufficient quantity of water to 100mL.' The null flavor would be used to express the quantity of water.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#QS	Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)
Trace (TRC, nullflavor)	The content is greater than zero, but too small to be quantified.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#TRC	Trace (TRC, nullflavor)
