Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)	The actual value has not yet been encoded within the approved value domain.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNC	Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)
Masked (MSK, nullflavor)	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons. There may be an alternate mechanism for gaining access to this information.	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#MSK	Masked (MSK, nullflavor)
Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)	Known to have no proper value (e.g., last menstrual period for a male).	HL7	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NA	Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)
