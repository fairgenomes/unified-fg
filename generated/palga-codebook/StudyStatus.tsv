Planned Clinical Study	A business process status of a clinical study which occurs before the study starts. A study plan on which the clinical trial is based focuses on several priority parameters that include but are not limited to the types of subjects eligible to participate in the study targeted accrual numbers schedules and durations of interventions the length of the study and the planned duration of a subject participation. These outlines are a part of a study protocol which is more a detailed and comprehensive study document.	NCIT	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C70704	Planned Clinical Study

When a proposed study is placed on clinical hold subjects may not be given the investigational product as part of the study. When an ongoing study is placed on clinical hold no new subjects may be recruited to the study and placed on the investigational product. Subjects already in the study have to stop receiving therapy involving the investigational agent unless the FDA specifically permits it.	NCIT	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C70755	Study on Hold
