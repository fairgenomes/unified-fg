sequencingmethod	Sequencing method	Method used to determine the order of bases in a nucleic acid sequence. (FIX:0000704 )	sequencingruns	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	unified-schema_sequencingruns_sequencingmethod
medianreaddepth	Median read depth	The median number of times a particular locus (site, nucleotide, amplicon, region) was sequenced. (NCIT:C155320 )	sequencingruns	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
observedreadlength	Observed read length	The number of nucleotides successfully ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process. (NCIT:C153362 )	sequencingruns	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
observedinsertsize	Observed insert size	In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance. (FG:0000002 )	sequencingruns	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
