identifier	Identifier	A unique proper name or character sequence that identifies this particular sample preparation. (NCIT:C132299 )	ngssamplepreparations	string	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	
belongstomaterials	Belongs to materials	Reference to the source material from which this sample was prepared. (NCIT:C93400, NCIT:C25683 )	ngssamplepreparations	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	unified-schema_materials
belongstolabprocedure	Belongs to lab procedure	Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting. (NCIT:C25294 )	ngssamplepreparations	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	unified-schema_laboratoryprocedures
belongstorequest	Belongs to request	A sequence of letters, numbers, or other characters that specifically identifies a particular order. (NCIT:C164567 )	ngssamplepreparations	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
inputamount	Input amount	Amount of input material in nanogram (ng). (AFRL:0000010 )	ngssamplepreparations	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
librarypreparationkit	Library preparation kit	Pre-filled, ready-to-use reagent cartridges intented to improve chemistry, cluster density and read length as well as improve quality (Q) scores for this sample. Reagent components are encoded to interact with the sequencing system to validate compatibility with user-defined applications. (GENEPIO:0000085 )	ngssamplepreparations	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	unified-schema_ngssamplepreparations_librarypreparationkit
pcrfree	PCR free	Indicates whether a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to prepare this sample. PCR is a method for amplifying a DNA base sequence using multiple rounds of heat denaturation of the DNA and annealing of oligonucleotide primers complementary to flanking regions in the presence of a heat-stable polymerase. (NCIT:C17003 )	ngssamplepreparations	bool	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
targetenrichmentkit	Target enrichment kit	Indicates which target enrichment kit was used to prepare this sample. Target enrichment is a pre-sequencing DNA preparation step where DNA sequences are either directly amplified (amplicon or multiplex PCR-based) or captured (hybrid capture-based) in order to only focus on specific regions of a genome or DNA sample. (NCIT:C154307 )	ngssamplepreparations	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	unified-schema_ngssamplepreparations_targetenrichmentkit
umispresent	UMIs present	Indicates whether any unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are present. An UMI barcode is a short nucleotide sequence that is used to identify reads originating from an individual mRNA molecule. (EFO:0010199 )	ngssamplepreparations	bool	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
intendedinsertsize	Intended insert size	In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance. (FG:0000001 )	ngssamplepreparations	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
intendedreadlength	Intended read length	The number of nucleotides intended to be ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process. (NCIT:C153362 )	ngssamplepreparations	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
barcode	Barcode	A machine-readable representation of information in a visual format on a surface. (NCIT:C43361 )	ngssamplepreparations	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
belongstobatch	Belongs to batch	A quantity of people or things treated or regarded as a group, especially when subdivided from a larger group. (NCIT:C67073 )	ngssamplepreparations	string	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
partofdatarelease	Part of data release	The act of making data or other structured information accessible to the public or to the user group of a database. (NCIT:C172217 )	ngssamplepreparations	mref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	unified-schema_datareleases
