identifier	Identifier	A unique proper name or character sequence that identifies this particular analysis. (AFR:0001979 )	ngsanalysis	string	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

physicaldatalocation	Physical data location	A place on the Earth where the data is located, by its name or by its geographical location. This definition is intentionally vague to allow reuse locally (e.g. which computer), for contacting (e.g. which institute), broadly for logistical or legal reasons (e.g. city, country or continent).

dataformatsstored	Data formats stored	Which data file formats (i.e. defined ways or layouts of representing and structuring data in a computer file, blob, string, message, or elsewhere) are stored and potentially available.

bioinformaticprotocoldeviation	Bioinformatic protocol deviation	A variation from processes or procedures defined in the bioinformatic protocol. Deviations usually do not preclude the overall evaluability of subject data for either efficacy or safety, and are often acknowledged and accepted in advance by the sponsor.
