NoInformation (NI, nullflavor)	The value is exceptional (missing, omitted, incomplete, improper). No information as to the reason for being an exceptional value is provided. This is the most general exceptional value. It is also the default exceptional value.	HL7	NI	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NI
Invalid (INV, nullflavor)	The value as represented in the instance is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.	HL7	INV	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#INV
Derived (DER, nullflavor)	An actual value may exist, but it must be derived from the provided information (usually an EXPR generic data type extension will be used to convey the derivation expression .	HL7	DER	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#DER
Other (OTH, nullflavor)	The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable. (e.g., concept not provided by required code system).	HL7	OTH	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#OTH
Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)	Negative infinity of numbers.	HL7	NINF	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NINF
Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)	Positive infinity of numbers.	HL7	PINF	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#PINF
Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)	The actual value has not yet been encoded within the approved value domain.	HL7	UNC	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNC
Masked (MSK, nullflavor)	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons. There may be an alternate mechanism for gaining access to this information.	HL7	MSK	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#MSK
Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)	Known to have no proper value (e.g., last menstrual period for a male).	HL7	NA	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NA
Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)	A proper value is applicable, but not known.	HL7	UNK	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#UNK
Asked but unknown (ASKU, nullflavor)	Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)	HL7	ASKU	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#ASKU
Temporarily unavailable (NAV, nullflavor)	Information is not available at this time but it is expected that it will be available later.	HL7	NAV	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NAV

Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)	The specific quantity is not known, but is known to be non-zero and is not specified because it makes up the bulk of the material. e.g. 'Add 10mg of ingredient X, 50mg of ingredient Y, and sufficient quantity of water to 100mL.' The null flavor would be used to express the quantity of water.	HL7	QS	http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#QS
