"Sufficient quantity (QS, nullflavor)","The specific quantity is not known, but is known to be non-zero and is not specified because it makes up the bulk of the material. e.g. 'Add 10mg of ingredient X, 50mg of ingredient Y, and sufficient quantity of water to 100mL.' The null flavor would be used to express the quantity of water.","HL7","QS","http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#QS"
