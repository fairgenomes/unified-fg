Benign	A genetic variant that is known to not contribute to the development of a disease.	NCIT	C168802	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C168802
Likely benign	A genetic variant that is not expected to contribute to the development of a disease, but the scientific evidence may be insufficient to prove this conclusively.	NCIT	C168801	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C168801
VUS	Variant of Unknown Significance	NCIT	C94187	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C94187
VUS plus	Variant of Unknown Significance	NCIT	C94187	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C94187
Likely pathogenic	A genetic variant that is known to have a high likelihood (greater than 90% certainty) to contribute to the development of a disease.	NCIT	C168800	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C168800
Pathogenic	A genetic variant that is known to directly contribute to the development of disease.	NCIT	C168799	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C168799
Risk factor	Any aspect of an individual's life, behavior, an environmental exposure, or an inborn or inherited characteristic that increases the likelihood of a disease, condition or injury.	NCIT	C17103	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C17103
Modifier	Usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no evidence of impact.	ENSGLOSSARY	0000139	http://ensembl.org/glossary/ENSGLOSSARY_0000139
