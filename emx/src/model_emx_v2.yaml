  # @title Clinical
  # @description metadata on clinical events including phenotypic information
  #   and diagnostic information
  # @section Notes:
  #
  # In some projects, this information is stored in the subjects table. However,
  # I like the Fair Genomes approach of separating this information. This module
  # is heavily influenced by FAIR Genomes, but the handling of linked family
  # members is different. If a family member is affected or has been sequenced,
  # then they will be added as a new record.
  #
  # Records are usually tied to a person rather than a unique clinical identifier.
  #
  # 1. I didn't add age at last screening. We usually don't have that information
  # 2. We also don't include medication or drug regimen
  # 3. Family members affected and sequenced is a bit tricky. If information family
  #     members are affected and sequenced, a new record would be created
  # 4. We also don't collect medical history (but we could)
  # 5. 'affectedStatus' could replace 'functioning'
  # 6. consanguinity is usually listed in the "persons" table. Should this be moved here?
  # 7. first contact is usually included inthe "persons" table. Move it here?
  #
  # In many projects, we have another reference list for phenotypes. We usually create
  # additional columns of each phenotypic attribute and use the FairGenomes columns
  # to map project data to HPO.
